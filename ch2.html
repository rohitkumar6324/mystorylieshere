                <p>Next day, Regwart woke up quite late. Aunt Fren was shouting at top of her voice. He went up in kitchen found that she was shouting about him as she was late for breakfast & it was Christmas feast today & many relatives were planned to come today at her home. Regwart quickly went to bathroom & brushed & bathed as fast as he can. On the other hand, Dren was still sleeping on his bed. For a moment Regwart thought about the face of Dren while he was sleeping. He would be looking like a pig who had been taught how to behave like human. A short giggle came in his mind. But the callous voice of uncle broke up his giggle. He yelled “Bloody Slow-Hedleys, where is today’s Gazette?”. For a split second Regwart thought for cursing him with a tongue-twisting curse but he controlled his anger as he knew that Uncle Mural was a better wizard than him. Regwart picked up the gazette from outside & went to him</p>

                <p>Out of the blue, someone knocked at the door. Regwart quickly went on to open the door & was dumbfounded to found Aunt Muriel at the door. She was quite old witch approximately 115-years-old with poor eyesight. She always treated Regwart as a girl & Dren always laughs whenever she treats him as a girl. Though Regwart didn’t like her whenever she treats him like that but he still never talked to her rudely as he respects her because she was the only one who talks to him nicely every time, she has met him. </p>
